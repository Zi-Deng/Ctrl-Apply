    description: |
      • Worked as an AI/ML consultant for the Innovation Pilot program for University of Arizona's AI Institute. Graduate students, faculty, and staff apply to the program to receive machine learning consultation, expertise and resources for their specific projects. Additionally aided in the planning of methods in which AI could be integrated into the University of Arizona campus at large.

  - title: "Graduate Researcher"

    description: |
      • Designed a deep learning framework for cost-sensitive image classification that implements configurable N×N cost matrices to optimize for asymmetric misclassification costs in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging (breast cancer detection) and dangerous species identification. The framework introduces a novel loss function utilizing dynamic alpha-scaled regularization, and logit adjustment and can be integrated into existing vision architectures such as ViT, ResNet and ConvNeXt with ease.
      • Developed FLOW-DC, a distributed downloader with policy-aware congestion control tailored for large-scale acquisition of machine learning datasets under the guidance of Dr. Nirav Merchant. It leverages TaskVine with a BBR inspired state machine to allow users to utilize a heterogeneous resource pool for machine learning dataset acquisition and processing. It is designed to be an improvement upon existing distributed downloaders such as img2dataset.
      • Created a set of machine learning models to support applications related to species classification: (1) AraNet, which utilizes a two-stage ConvNeXtV2 design, combining intermediate fine-tuning and downstream distillation to perform species identification, and (2) OspideR, an ensemble OOD detector for new species detection that constructs a Mahalanobis distance based score for each in-distribution class and takes the minimum of that pool to construct an output anomaly score.

      • Collaborated with AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA) as part of a cross-institutional team to create the following deep vision models: (1) InsectNet, which utilizes SSL pre-training with a RegNetY32 architecture for insect and pest classification, and (2) WeedNet, which utilizes Masked Autoencoder ViT architecture for weed species classification.
      • Worked with Dr. Arti Singh and Dr. Baskar Ganapathysubramanian to construct BioTrove, an open-access benchmark dataset for machine learning/artificial intelligence applications in biodiversity (161.9 million images), and TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark dataset to support OOD detection for species discovery.
